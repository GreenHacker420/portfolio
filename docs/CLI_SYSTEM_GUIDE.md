- Context-aware suggestions based on current page
- Fuzzy matching for partial commands

### Auto-completion Examples
```bash
$ sk<Tab>           # Completes to "skills"

$ git<Tab>          # Shows "github" completion
```

## Command History

The CLI maintains a persistent command history with the following features:
- **Persistent Storage**: History is saved in localStorage
- **Navigation**: Use â†‘/â†“ arrows to navigate through previous commands
- **Search**: Use `history search <term>` to find specific commands
- **Management**: Use `history clear` to clear all history

### History Commands
```bash
$ history              # Show last 10 commands
$ history search git   # Search for commands containing "git"
$ history clear        # Clear all command history
```

## Error Handling

The CLI provides comprehensive error handling:
- **Invalid Commands**: Suggests similar commands for typos
- **Missing Arguments**: Clear error messages for required arguments
- **API Failures**: Graceful fallbacks when AI services are unavailable

- **Hook-based State**: Custom hooks for command history and completion
- **Service Layer**: Separate service layer for command processing
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive types

### Adding New Commands
To add a new command, follow these steps:

1. Define the command in `src/services/cliCommandService.ts`:
```typescript
const newCommand: CLICommand = {
  name: 'newcommand',
  description: 'Description of the new command',
  usage: 'newcommand [options]',
  category: CLI_CATEGORIES.INFO,
  handler: async (args: string[], context: CLIContext) => {
    // Command implementation
    return formatOutput(['Command output'], 'success');
  }
};
```

2. Register the command in the `registerCommands` function
3. Add auto-completion if needed
4. Update documentation

### Testing
The CLI includes comprehensive testing:
- **Unit Tests**: Individual command testing
- **Integration Tests**: Full CLI workflow testing
- **E2E Tests**: Browser-based testing with Playwright
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing for command execution

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**CLI not opening**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
**Commands not working**: Verify API endpoints are accessible
**Auto-completion not working**: Check if Tab key is being intercepted
**History not persisting**: Verify localStorage is enabled

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode by adding `?debug=true` to the URL for additional logging.

## Future Enhancements

Planned features for future releases:
- **Navigation Commands**: `cd` command for section navigation
- **File System Simulation**: Virtual file system for portfolio content
- **Themes**: Multiple CLI themes and customization options
