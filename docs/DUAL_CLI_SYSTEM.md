### 1. **Dual Interface Access**
```
Portfolio Page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Command CLI (Right) - For structured commands
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AI Assistant CLI (Left) - For natural language queries
```

### 2. **Command CLI Workflow**
```bash
$ help                    # Discover available commands
$ about                   # Learn about the developer
$ skills frontend         # Explore specific skills
$ projects               # View portfolio projects
$ ask "What's your experience with React?"  # Switch to AI
```

### 3. **AI Assistant Workflow**
```
$ What technologies do you specialize in?
ü§ñ AI Response:
‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê
I specialize in modern web technologies including...

üí° Quick suggestions:
‚Üí Show me his recent projects
‚Üí Is he available for freelance work?
```

### 4. **Cross-Interface Integration**
- **Command CLI ‚Üí AI**: Use `ask` command or `chat` mode
- **AI Assistant**: Natural language queries with CLI-style responses
- **Shared Context**: Both interfaces are aware of current page context
- **Consistent Theming**: Both use terminal aesthetics with different accent colors
