Aceternity UI usage notes

- This project re-implements select Aceternity UI patterns with Tailwind utilities to avoid external registry coupling.
- Components live next to the sections they enhance (e.g., ProjectPinCard under sections/projects).
- Prefer subtle motion and cohesive spacing; keep components under 100 lines.
