# Keyboard Sound Effects

This directory contains sound effects for the mechanical keyboard visualization.

In a real implementation, you would include actual sound files like:
- `key-press-1.mp3` - Standard key press sound
- `key-press-2.mp3` - Alternative key press sound
- `spacebar.mp3` - Spacebar sound
- `enter.mp3` - Enter key sound
- `backspace.mp3` - Backspace key sound

For this demo, we'll use the Web Audio API to generate synthetic keyboard sounds.
